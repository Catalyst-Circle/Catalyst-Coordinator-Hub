# Funds

## Test Transactions

When you have completed your onboarding form, and given a wallet address for your proposal, you will receive a test transaction of 1 ADA.

You will receive 1 ADA _per wallet_, not per proposal - so if you are using the same wallet for more than one proposal (which is not usually considered best practice, but still, some people do it), you will only receive 1 ADA for the wallet as a whole.

You will also get an email to say that the text transaction has been sent. You need to reply to this email to confirm that you have received it.

## First Release of Funds

Your initial payment as a newly-funded proposal will be separate from the usual monthly payment date for existing funded proposals from previous Funds.

Check the Proposers and Catalyst Coordinator channels on Telegram for announcements.
