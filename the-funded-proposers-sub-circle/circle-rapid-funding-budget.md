# Circle Rapid Funding budget

Via the F8 _Circle Rapid Funding Mechanism_ proposal (managed by Treasury Guild), each Catalyst Circle seat - including Funded Proposers - has access to a budget of $7,000 to pay for quick solutions to community-sensed issues. The Funded Proposers' SubCircle is agreeing on how to spend the Funded Proposer money.

Below is a spreadsheet of expenditure.
