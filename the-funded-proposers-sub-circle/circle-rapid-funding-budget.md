# Circle Rapid Funding budget

Based on the F8 Circle Rapid Funding Mechanism (managed by Treasury Guild), each Catalyst Circle seat - including Funded Proposers - has access to a budget of $7,000 to pay for quick solutions to community-sensed issues. The Funded Proposers' SubCircle is agreeing on how to spend this money.

Below is a spreadsheet of expenditure.
