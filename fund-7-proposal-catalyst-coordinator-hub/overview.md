## Problem statement

Proposers funded by Catalyst lack a collaborative layer to answer FAQ questions, leave feedback and raise issues.

## Solution

Implement a collaborative layer, a community hub, to welcome funded proposers to Catalyst and provide support.

## **Background**

A key Prioritized Problem handed over to Catalyst Circle V2 was "Cohort: Almost non existing "collaborative layer" to welcome newcomers" ( [https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/activities/catalyst-prioritized-problems-trello#cohort-almost-non-existing-collaborative-layer-to-welcome-newcomers](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/activities/catalyst-prioritized-problems-trello#cohort-almost-non-existing-collaborative-layer-to-welcome-newcomers) ).

To begin to address this problem, to gather feedback and to track issues Stephen Whitenstall set up a Catalyst Coordinator GitBook for problem-sensing the Funded Cohort process in November 2021.

This was announced at Fund 7 Town Hall #3 on 1st December 2021.

### **Catalyst Coordinator GitBook**

The Catalyst Coordinator GitBook (https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/) provides :

* A useful FAQ for funded proposers - [https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/)
* A means to gather feedback for Catalyst Circle and the community - [https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/feedback](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/feedback)
* A reference tool for the Coordinator community.

### **Catalyst Coordinator Feedback Repository**

A GitHub Repository documents and tracks issues raised by the funded proposer community - [https://github.com/Catalyst-Coordinator/Feedback/issues](https://github.com/Catalyst-Coordinator/Feedback/issues)

## Budget

The total budget for this proposal was a modest $4,350. This covered maintenance of the GitBook and backend GitHub repository for 3 months at $ 3,150 and engagement on social media (Telegram/Discord) over 3 months for $ 1,200. The actual work period lasted between November 2021 and February 2022.&#x20;

### _Maintenance_

Regular updates over 3 months (21 hours per month) to add content

$50 per hour for 63 hours (21 x 3) = $ 3,150

### _Engagement_

Promotion, engagement and communication on social media (Twitter, Telegram, Youtube, Discord, Reddit).

2 hours per week for 3 months = 24 hours = $50 hour for 24 hours = $ 1,200

Total: $4,350

## **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**

* Amount of material added to the GitBook
* Feedback received for Catalyst Circle and the community
* Amount of commentary on GitBook and on social media
* Page views and dwell time
* Number of issues from the Coordinator community that are raised and explored by Catalyst Circle.

## **Roadmap**

### _Prior to funding_

The Catalyst Coordinator GitBook and GitHub is currently being maintained.

### _Once Funded (February to April 2022)_

Once funded, Catalyst Coordinator GitBook and GitHub will sustain communications, provide a documentation platform and a means to gather feedback for the funded proposer community.
