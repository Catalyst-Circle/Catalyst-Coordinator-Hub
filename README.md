### On-boarding

Once funded you will be required to attend an [on-boarding](coordinator-processes/onboarding.md) meeting for "proof of life".

### Funds

After you have completed a "proof of life" you will receive a [test transaction](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/coordinator-processes/funds#test-transactions) to the ADA wallet you specified in your on-boarding form.
