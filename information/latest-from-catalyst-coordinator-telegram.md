### Remodel of the reporting document

\[Forwarded from Catalyst Coordinator Announcements (Daniel Ribar - beware of scam)] 🥁

Quick heads up - in an effort to bring more clarity and accountability to the community - I remodelled the reporting document which is publicly facing and shows the following information now:

👉 Funds allocated, distributed to date, remaining 👉 Which projects are completed 👉 Form submission etiquette - Progress Reports & KPI reports 👉 If you have multiple projects and not reporting on all - this may also affect future fund dispersion - make sure to add all project reports where applicable.

👀 If you spot anything out of ordinary - please ping me via DMs and let's sort it. Appreciate the patience. F6 cohort is yet to be added.
