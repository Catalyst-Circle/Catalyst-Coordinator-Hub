## On-boarding

Once funded you will receive an email providing instructions and you will be required to attend an on-boarding meeting for "proof of life".

See the [on-boarding section](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/coordinator-processes/onboarding) for further information
{% endhint %}

## Funds

After you have completed a "_proof of life_" you will receive a [test transaction](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-coordinator/coordinator-processes/funds#test-transactions) to the ADA wallet you specified in your on-boarding form.

After you have confirmed your test transaction a portion of the funds granted in your proposal will be released.
